# Car Shapes

**All of the information about car choices can be overwhelming. But in this sense it is merely a set of spirals.**

Choosing different definitions of x, y, and size made each of my spirals from different functions unique. Altering the lapha on the segments alo allowed more complexity to be visible.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("viridis")
library(viridis)
```

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year/100 + hwy,
    y = cty,
    xend = hwy,
    yend = cty/100+displ-10,
    colour = class,
    size = year/1000
  )) +
  geom_segment(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_line(aes(x = cty, y = hwy, size = cty)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = cty+hwy, y = -2*(cty*hwy)^0.5, size = displ/20, colour = manufacturer)) +
  coord_polar() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "A")+

  scale_size(range = c(0, 10)) + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "None")

# Kaya Devolved

**One file contains a grid of pixels. Another merely contains a set of shapes and colors. Is one a more true representation than the other?**

I selected the color pallete very intentionally using the most important colors of the dog. By selecting gen_worley I created the cool mosaic pattern. I selected a very high frequency of 90 to include all of the colors well and allow more complex patterns. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
#install.packages("ambient")
library(ambient)
```


```{r}
make_noise_art <- function(
    generator = gen_perlin, 
    frequency = 10, 
    seed = 1234,
    pixels = 2000,
    palette = c("#e5ddc8", "#01949a", "#004369", "#db1f48"), 
    ...
) {
  
  # define the grid
  canvas <- long_grid(
    x = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = pixels),
    y = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = pixels)
  ) 
  
  # use the generator to add paint
  canvas <- canvas |>
    mutate(
      paint = generator(
        x, y, 
        frequency = frequency, 
        seed = seed, 
        ...
      )
    )
  
  # use ggplot2 to draw the picture
  art <- canvas |> 
    ggplot(aes(x, y, fill = paint)) + 
    geom_raster(show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_void() +
    coord_equal() +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours = palette)
  
  return(art)
}
```

```{r}
# Colors sampled from a picture of a beloved dog called Kaya
kaya_palette = c( "#FBF8D7", "#E2BE82", "#020514", "#FBF8D7", "#E2BE82", "#020514", "#E2BE82", "#FBF8D7", "#6B3E1D", "#FBF8D7", "#020514")
make_noise_art(seed = 3474, pixels = 900, generator = gen_worley,
